This Style Guide outlines the typographic hierarchy, text formatting, and common Markdown elements used throughout this template. Adhering to these guidelines ensures consistency, readability, and a professional appearance across all documentation and content.

## Typographic Hierarchy

A well-defined typographic hierarchy helps users quickly scan and understand the structure of your content.

# H1: Main Page Title
This is the largest heading, typically used for the main title of a page or a major section. It should be used sparingly, usually once per page.

## H2: Section Heading
Used for major sections within a page. H2s break down the content into digestible parts, making it easier to navigate.

### H3: Sub-section Heading
For sub-sections under an H2. H3s provide further granularity and organization within a section.

#### H4: Minor Heading
Used for smaller divisions of content, often for specific points or lists within a sub-section.

##### H5: Detail Heading
The smallest heading, used for very specific details or labels.

###### H6: Fine Print Heading
Rarely used, but available for extremely fine-grained organization or technical labels.

## Paragraph Text

P: This is the standard paragraph style. It is used for the main body of your content. Ensure paragraphs are concise and focused on a single idea to improve readability.

**Example:**
This is an example of a standard paragraph. It should be easy to read and provide clear information. The line height and font size are optimized for comfortable reading on various devices.

## Text Formatting

### Bold Text
To make text **bold**, use two asterisks or two underscores around the text.
**Example:** `**important**` or `__important__`

### Italic Text
To make text *italic*, use one asterisk or one underscore around the text.
*Example:* `*emphasis*` or `_emphasis_`

### Strikethrough Text
To apply ~~strikethrough~~, use two tildes around the text.
~~Example:~~ `~~deleted text~~`

### Code Snippets
For `inline code`, use backticks.
`Example: ` `const variable = "value";`

For code blocks, use triple backticks and specify the language for syntax highlighting.

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code block
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`function greet(name) {
  console.log(\`Hello, ${name}!\`);
}

greet("World");`} />

```html
<!-- Example HTML code block -->
<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`<div class="container">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>`} />

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
Use hyphens, asterisks, or plus signs for unordered lists.
*   Item one
*   Item two
    *   Nested item
*   Item three

### Ordered Lists
Use numbers followed by a period for ordered lists.
1.  First item
2.  Second item
    1.  Nested ordered item
3.  Third item

## Links

To create a [link](https://example.com), use square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL.
[Example Link to Google](https://www.google.com)

## Blockquotes

Use the `>` character for blockquotes.
> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do."
> - Steve Jobs

## Horizontal Rule

To insert a horizontal rule, use three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves.
---

## Images

To embed an image, use an exclamation mark, followed by square brackets for alt text, and parentheses for the image URL.
![Alt text for image](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200 "Optional title for image")

## Tables

Create tables using hyphens for the header separator and pipes for column dividers.

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1 Col 1 | Row 1 Col 2 | Row 1 Col 3 |
| Row 2 Col 1 | Row 2 Col 2 | Row 2 Col 3 |
| Row 3 Col 1 | Row 3 Col 2 | Row 3 Col 3 |
