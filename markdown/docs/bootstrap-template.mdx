## Downloading Templates

All available templates, especially those included in the comprehensive bundle, can be accessed and downloaded directly from your GrayGrids account. You retain the flexibility to download these templates at any time, provided your account remains active.

## **Installing Templates**

To begin using your downloaded Bootstrap template, follow these installation steps carefully:

**Step 1: Download the Template**
Navigate to your GrayGrids account and download the desired Bootstrap template. The download will typically be a `.zip` file containing all necessary project files.

**Step 2: Extract the Zip File**
Locate the downloaded `.zip` file and extract its contents to a directory of your choice. This action will reveal the template's complete file structure, including all assets, HTML files, and configuration files.

**Step 3: Open in Code Editor and Customize**
Open the extracted template folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom). This is where you will begin customizing the content, styling, and functionality to meet your specific project requirements. Familiarize yourself with the HTML structure and linked CSS/JS files.

**Step 4: Upload to Your Server**
Once you have customized the template, you need to upload it to your web server. You can do this via:
*   **cPanel:** Log in to your cPanel, navigate to the File Manager, and upload the extracted files to your public web directory (e.g., `public_html` or `www`).
*   **FTP Client:** Use an FTP client like Filezilla. Connect to your server using your FTP credentials and transfer all template files to the designated root directory of your website (e.g., `/`).

**Verification:**
After successful upload, open your web browser and navigate to `yourdomainname.com/index.html` (or just `yourdomainname.com` if `index.html` is in the root). You should now see your customized website live.

## **Directory Structure**

Upon extracting the template folder, you will observe a well-organized directory structure designed for clarity and ease of use:

```
|-- Template Folder/
    |-- assets/                 # Contains all static assets for the template
    |    |-- css/               # All compiled CSS files, including main.css
    |       |-- main.css        # Main stylesheet for global styles
    |       |-- other-styles.css # Any additional component-specific styles
    |    |-- scss/              # Source SCSS files for pre-processing (if applicable)
    |       |-- _variables.scss # SCSS variables for colors, fonts, etc.
    |       |-- _mixins.scss    # Reusable SCSS mixins
    |       |-- style.scss      # Main SCSS file that imports other partials
    |    |-- js/                # All JavaScript files for interactivity
    |       |-- main.js         # Main JavaScript file for custom scripts
    |       |-- plugins.js      # Bundled third-party JavaScript plugins
    |    |-- fonts/             # Custom font files (e.g., .woff, .ttf)
    |       |-- fontawesome.woff # Example font file
    |    |-- images/            # All image assets used in the template
    |       |-- hero-bg.jpg     # Background images, logos, icons
    |       |-- logo.png
    |-- index.html              # The main entry point HTML file
|-- about.html              # Example of other HTML pages
|-- contact.html
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`|-- Template Folder/
    |-- assets/                 # Contains all static assets for the template
    |    |-- css/               # All compiled CSS files, including main.css
    |       |-- main.css        # Main stylesheet for global styles

    |       |-- style.scss      # Main SCSS file that imports other partials
    |    |-- js/                # All JavaScript files for interactivity
    |       |-- main.js         # Main JavaScript file for custom scripts
    |       |-- plugins.js      # Bundled third-party JavaScript plugins
    |    |-- fonts/             # Custom font files (e.g., .woff, .ttf)
    |       |-- fontawesome.woff # Example font file

    |       |-- hero-bg.jpg     # Background images, logos, icons
    |       |-- logo.png
    |-- index.html              # The main entry point HTML file
|-- about.html              # Example of other HTML pages
|-- contact.html`} />

**Explanation of Directories:**
*   `assets/`: This is the primary folder for all static resources.
    *   `css/`: Contains the compiled CSS files. `main.css` is typically where the core styling resides.
    *   `scss/`: If the template uses Sass/SCSS for styling, this folder will contain the source `.scss` files. This allows for more organized and maintainable stylesheets.
    *   `js/`: Holds all JavaScript files responsible for dynamic behavior, animations, and interactive elements.
    *   `fonts/`: Stores custom font files used in the template.
    *   `images/`: Contains all visual assets such as logos, background images, icons, and other graphics.
*   `*.html`: These are the main HTML files that constitute the different pages of your website. `index.html` is usually the homepage.

## **Customization**

Customizing your Bootstrap template allows you to align it with your brand identity and specific design requirements.

### **Changing Default Theme Color**

To modify the default theme color, follow these steps:
1.  Open the `assets/css/main.css` file in your code editor.
2.  Search for the default color values (e.g., `#6577F2`, `rgb(101, 119, 242)`). These are often defined as CSS variables or directly applied to elements.
3.  Replace these values with your desired hex code, RGB, or HSL color.

**Example (CSS):**
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #6577F2; /* Original */
  --secondary-color: #333;
}

/* Change to a new primary color */
:root {
  --primary-color: #FF5733; /* New vibrant orange */
}
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`:root {
  --primary-color: #6577F2; /* Original */
  --secondary-color: #333;
}

/* Change to a new primary color */
:root {
  --primary-color: #FF5733; /* New vibrant orange */
}`} />

**Note for SCSS Users:**
If the template utilizes SCSS, the most efficient way to change the theme color is by modifying the SCSS variables.
1.  Locate the `assets/scss/_variables.scss` file (or a similar file named `_colors.scss`).
2.  Find the variable defining the primary color (e.g., `$primary-color`, `$theme-color`).
3.  Update its value to your preferred color. After saving, you will need to compile your SCSS to CSS for the changes to take effect.

**Example (SCSS):**
```scss
// assets/scss/_variables.scss
$primary-color: #6577F2; // Original color
$secondary-color: #333;

// Change to a new primary color
$primary-color: #00BFFF; // New deep sky blue
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`// assets/scss/_variables.scss
$primary-color: #6577F2; // Original color
$secondary-color: #333;

// Change to a new primary color
$primary-color: #00BFFF; // New deep sky blue`} />

### **Changing Default Font Family**

To change the default font family used throughout the template:
1.  Open the `assets/css/main.css` file.
2.  Search for `font-family` properties. These are typically applied to the `body` element or specific text elements.
3.  Replace the existing font stack with your desired font family.

**Important:** Ensure that the font you wish to use is properly included in your project. This usually involves linking a Google Fonts URL in your HTML `<head>` or importing a font file in your CSS.

**Example (CSS):**
```css
body {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif; /* Original */
}

/* Change to a new font family */
body {
  font-family: "Roboto", Arial, sans-serif; /* New font stack */
}
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`body {
  font-family: "Inter", sans-serif; /* Original */
}

/* Change to a new font family */
body {
  font-family: "Roboto", Arial, sans-serif; /* New font stack */
}`} />

**Note for SCSS Users:**
Similar to colors, if SCSS is used, you can modify font variables in `assets/scss/_variables.scss` (or `_typography.scss`).
```scss
// assets/scss/_variables.scss
$font-body: "Inter", sans-serif; // Original font

// Change to a new font
$font-body: "Open Sans", sans-serif; // New font
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`// assets/scss/_variables.scss
$font-body: "Inter", sans-serif; // Original font

// Change to a new font
$font-body: "Open Sans", sans-serif; // New font`} />
Remember to recompile your SCSS after making changes.

## **Plugins and Libraries**
