## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on configuring and integrating contact forms within both Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap templates. A functional contact form is crucial for user engagement, allowing visitors to communicate directly with you. This guide will cover traditional PHP-based solutions and recommend a modern, serverless approach using FormBold.

## Using PHP Contact Form (Legacy Method)

For older Bootstrap templates, a PHP script was often provided to handle form submissions. This method relies on a PHP-enabled server with the `phpmailer` function properly configured and running.

**Configuration Steps:**
1.  **Locate the PHP Script:** Open the `assets/php/contact.php` file within your template's directory.
2.  **Update Email Address:** Find the line where the recipient email address is defined (e.g., `$to = "your-email@example.com";`). Replace `"your-email@example.com"` with your actual email address where you wish to receive form submissions.

**Example (`contact.php` snippet):**
```php
<?php
// The email address where you want to receive messages
$to = "your-email@example.com"; // <--- CHANGE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS

// Subject of the email
$subject = "New Contact Form Submission";

// ... rest of the PHP script for handling form data and sending email
?>
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`<?php
// The email address where you want to receive messages
$to = "your-email@example.com"; // <--- CHANGE THIS EMAIL ADDRESS

// Subject of the email
$subject = "New Contact Form Submission";

// ... rest of the PHP script for handling form data and sending email
?>`} />

**Important Considerations:**
*   This method requires a server environment that supports PHP.
*   The `phpmailer` function (or similar mail sending capabilities) must be enabled and correctly configured on your server.
*   Security: PHP forms can be vulnerable to spam and injection attacks if not properly secured. Consider adding server-side validation and reCAPTCHA.

## Using FormBold: A Universal Form API (Recommended)

[FormBold](https://formbold.com/) offers a robust, serverless form backend solution that seamlessly integrates with any hosting environment, Static Site Generator (SSG), or JavaScript framework. Given that many modern web projects do not rely on PHP servers, FormBold provides a highly recommended, efficient, and scalable alternative for making your contact forms dynamic.

**Benefits of FormBold:**
*   **Serverless:** No need to manage server-side code or databases.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Works with any frontend technology.
*   **Spam Protection:** Built-in reCAPTCHA integration.
*   **Integrations:** Connects with popular services like Webhooks, Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, and more.
*   **Ease of Use:** Simple setup and management through a user-friendly dashboard.

**Connecting FormBold API with Your Contact Form:**

**Step 1: Create a FormBold Account and Form**
1.  Visit [FormBold.com](https://formbold.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2.  Once logged in, navigate to your dashboard and create a new form. FormBold will provide you with a unique form endpoint URL.

**Step 2: Integrate the API into Your HTML Form**
Modify your existing HTML contact form to point to your unique FormBold endpoint. Ensure your form's `method` attribute is set to `POST`.

**HTML Form Example:**
```html
<form action="https://formbold.com/s/unique_form_id" method="POST">
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Your Email</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="your.email@example.com" name="email" required />
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="subject">Subject</label>
    <input type="text" id="subject" placeholder="Enter subject" name="subject" required />
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="message">Your Message</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" placeholder="Type your message here..." rows="5" required></textarea>
  </div>

  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

**Locating Your `unique_form_id`:**
Your `unique_form_id` is crucial for directing submissions to your FormBold form. You can find this ID in your [FormBold dashboard](https://formbold.com/dashboard) under **Settings > Integration** for the specific form you created. Copy this ID and paste it into the `action` attribute of your HTML `<form>` tag.

**Advanced FormBold Features:**
Beyond basic setup, FormBold offers a suite of advanced features to enhance your contact form:
*   **Spam Protection:** Implement reCAPTCHA to prevent bot submissions.
*   **Custom Redirects:** Redirect users to a "thank you" page after submission.
*   **Email Notifications:** Configure custom email templates for notifications.
*   **Integrations:** Connect your form submissions to various third-party services for automated workflows.
