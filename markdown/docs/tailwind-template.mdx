## Introduction

This documentation provides comprehensive instructions on how to install, use, and customize Tailwind CSS templates downloaded from GrayGrids. It also addresses common issues and offers solutions to ensure a smooth development experience. Tailwind CSS templates are pre-built web layouts and components that leverage the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, allowing for rapid development and highly customizable designs without writing custom CSS.

Should you encounter any questions beyond the scope of this documentation, please feel free to [Open a Support Ticket](https://uideck.com/support/) or connect with us on [Discord](https://pimjo.com/discord). Our support team is dedicated to providing prompt assistance.

These Tailwind templates are primarily built with plain HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a minimal set of Vanilla JavaScript scripts for core functionalities. For enhanced interactivity, such as sliders, video popups, and image lightboxes, we utilize [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), a lightweight JavaScript framework that offers reactive and declarative templating directly in your HTML.

## Downloading Templates

All available Tailwind CSS templates, especially those included in the comprehensive bundle, can be accessed and downloaded directly from your GrayGrids account. You have the flexibility to download these templates at any time, provided your account remains active.

## Directory Structure

Upon downloading and extracting a Tailwind CSS template, you will find a well-organized folder structure designed for easy navigation and customization:

```

    |-- src/                    # Source files for development
    |    |-- css/               # Source CSS files (e.g., input.css with Tailwind directives)
    |       |-- input.css       # Main input file for Tailwind CSS

**Explanation of Key Directories and Files:**
*   **`src/`**: This directory contains all the source files you will be working with during development.
    *   `src/css/`: Holds your input CSS files, including the main file where Tailwind directives are imported.
    *   `src/js/`: Contains custom JavaScript files and Alpine.js initialization scripts.
    *   `src/images/`: Stores all image assets used in the template.
    *   `src/partials/`: A common practice in static site development, this folder contains reusable HTML snippets (like headers, footers, navigation bars) that are often included in main HTML files using a build tool.
    *   `src/*.html`: Your main HTML pages.
*   **`public/` (or `dist/` or `build/`)**: This directory is typically generated after running the build command. It contains the optimized, compiled, and production-ready versions of your CSS, JavaScript, images, and HTML files. This is the folder you will upload to your web server for deployment.
*   **`tailwind.config.js`**: This is the core configuration file for Tailwind CSS. Here, you can customize your design system, extend Tailwind's default utility classes, add custom plugins, and configure the `content` array to specify which files Tailwind should scan for classes.
*   **`postcss.config.js`**: Configuration for PostCSS, which Tailwind CSS uses to process your CSS. It often includes Autoprefixer for vendor prefixes.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines your project's metadata, scripts (like `start` and `build`), and lists all project dependencies (e.g., `tailwindcss`, `alpinejs`).

To customize the template, you will primarily work within the `src/` folder, modifying the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed.

## Installing Templates

To begin using your Tailwind CSS template, you first need to install its dependencies and set up the development environment.

**Prerequisite:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager), which is essential for installing project dependencies.

Follow these steps to install and run your template:

**Step 1: Download and Extract the Template**
1.  Download the Tailwind CSS template from your GrayGrids account.
2.  Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file to your desired project directory. This will create the `Template Folder` with the structure described above.

**Step 2: Install Project Dependencies**
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root of your extracted project folder (e.g., `cd path/to/Template Folder`), and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm install`} />
This command reads the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` listed in your `package.json` file and installs all necessary packages (like Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, and any build tools) into the `node_modules` directory. This process usually takes a few seconds.

**Step 3: Start the Development Server**
Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server by running:

```sh
npm run start
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm run start`} />
This command typically executes a script defined in `package.json` (e.g., `tailwindcss --watch` or a more complex build process with a local server). Upon successful execution, your project will automatically open in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address.

Now, you can begin customizing the default content, adding your own sections, and making design changes. Any modifications you save in the `src/` directory will be automatically recompiled and reflected in your browser in real-time, thanks to the `--watch` flag often used in the `start` script.

## Deploying to a Server

To make your Tailwind CSS template live on a web server, you need to generate a production-ready build of your project. This process typically optimizes and minifies your assets for performance.

**Step 1: Generate the Production Build**
In your terminal, from the root of your project folder, run the build command:

```sh
npm run build
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm run build`} />
This command executes the `build` script defined in your `package.json`. This script usually compiles your Tailwind CSS, processes JavaScript, optimizes images, and bundles all assets into a production-ready folder (commonly named `build`, `dist`, or `public`).

**Step 2: Upload the Build Folder**
After the build process completes, you will find a newly created `build` (or `dist`/`public`) folder in your project's root directory. This folder contains all the necessary files for your website.

To deploy, simply upload the *entire contents* of this `build` folder to your web hosting server's public directory (e.g., `public_html`, `www`, or `htdocs`). You can use an FTP client (like Filezilla) or your hosting provider's file manager for this purpose.

Once uploaded, your website will be live and accessible via your domain name.
