## Basic Use and Download

GrayGrids provides a comprehensive collection of essential Tailwind UI components available with the All-Access Plan. These components are designed for flexibility, allowing you to seamlessly integrate them into your existing Tailwind CSS projects or to serve as a foundation for building entirely new web applications from scratch.

You can access these components directly by copying and pasting the code snippets into your project. Additionally, for offline development or local backups, you have the option to download the complete component files from the dedicated downloads section within your GrayGrids account.

## Configuration and Integration

This section details how to configure and integrate GrayGrids components into your projects. We will cover two primary scenarios: starting a new project from scratch with Tailwind CSS and integrating GrayGrids into an existing Tailwind CSS project.

### 1. Starting a New Project with GrayGrids Components

This guide will walk you through setting up a new Tailwind CSS project and then incorporating GrayGrids components.

**Step 1: Initialize Tailwind CSS**
First, you need to set up Tailwind CSS in your project. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p`} />
*   `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`: Installs Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as development dependencies. PostCSS is a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript, and Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
*   `npx tailwindcss init -p`: Generates two files: `tailwind.config.js` (your Tailwind configuration file) and `postcss.config.js` (your PostCSS configuration file).

**Step 2: Install TailGrids**
TailGrids is the underlying library that powers GrayGrids components. Install it as a dependency:

```sh
npm i tailgrids
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm i tailgrids`} />
This command adds the `tailgrids` package to your project, making its plugins and utilities available for use with Tailwind CSS.

**Step 3: Configure `tailwind.config.js`**
Update your `tailwind.config.js` file to include the `tailgrids` plugin and configure the `content` array to scan your project files for Tailwind classes.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", // Ensure this path covers your source files
    "./node_modules/tailgrids/dist/**/*.js", // Include TailGrids for its classes
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}, // Extend Tailwind's default theme here
  },
  plugins: [
    require("tailgrids/plugin"), // Add the TailGrids plugin
  ],
};
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}", // Ensure this path covers your source files
    "./node_modules/tailgrids/dist/**/*.js", // Include TailGrids for its classes
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}, // Extend Tailwind's default theme here
  },
  plugins: [
    require("tailgrids/plugin"), // Add the TailGrids plugin
  ],
};`} />
*   **`content`**: This array tells Tailwind CSS which files to scan for Tailwind classes. Make sure it includes all your HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and MDX files, as well as the `tailgrids` package itself.
*   **`plugins`**: This is where you register the `tailgrids/plugin` to enable all the custom components and utilities provided by TailGrids.

**Step 4: Add Tailwind Directives to Your CSS**
Create an input CSS file (e.g., `src/input.css` or `styles/globals.css`) and include Tailwind's base, components, and utilities directives.

```css
/* src/input.css or styles/globals.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`/* src/input.css or styles/globals.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;`} />
These directives are processed by Tailwind CSS to inject its preflight styles, component classes, and utility classes into your final CSS output.

**Step 5: Build Your CSS**
Add a build script to your `package.json` file to compile your Tailwind CSS. This command will process your `input.css` (or equivalent) and generate the final `output.css` file.

```json
// package.json
{
  "name": "my-tailwind-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch",
    "dev": "next dev", // Example for Next.js
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "tailwindcss": "^3.x",
    "postcss": "^8.x",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "tailgrids": "^1.x"
  }
}
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`{
  "name": "my-tailwind-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch",
    "dev": "next dev", // Example for Next.js
    "start": "next start"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "tailwindcss": "^3.x",
    "postcss": "^8.x",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.x"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "tailgrids": "^1.x"
  }
}`} />
*   `"build:css"`: This script uses the `tailwindcss` CLI to process your input CSS file (`-i`) and output the compiled CSS to a specified location (`-o`). The `--watch` flag is useful for development, as it automatically recompiles your CSS whenever changes are detected.

Run the build command:
```sh
npm run build:css
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`npm run build:css`} />
For development, you might run this in a separate terminal alongside your development server.

**Step 6: Link the Compiled CSS in Your HTML**
Finally, link the generated `output.css` file in your HTML file (e.g., `public/index.html` or your main layout file in a framework like Next.js).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Tailwind Project</title>
    <link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet" /> <!-- Link to your compiled CSS -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-600 text-center my-8">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</h1>
    <!-- Your GrayGrids components will go here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
<CodeCopyButton code={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Tailwind Project</title>
    <link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet" /> <!-- Link to your compiled CSS -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-extrabold text-blue-600 text-center my-8">Hello, Tailwind CSS!</h1>
    <!-- Your GrayGrids components will go here -->
  </body>
</html>`} />
With these steps completed, your project is now set up to use Tailwind CSS and GrayGrids components. You can now copy and paste any component from GrayGrids into your HTML or component files, and Tailwind will process the classes to generate the necessary styles.

### 2. Using GrayGrids with an Existing Tailwind Project

Integrating GrayGrids into an existing Tailwind CSS project is straightforward, as most of the initial setup for Tailwind CSS is already complete.

**Step 1: Install TailGrids**
If you haven't already, install the `tailgrids` package:

```sh
npm i tailgrids
```

**Step 2: Update `tailwind.config.js`**
Modify your existing `tailwind.config.js` file to include the `tailgrids` plugin and ensure your `content` array correctly scans the `tailgrids` package.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ... your existing content paths
    "./node_modules/tailgrids/dist/**/*.js", // Add this line
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require("tailgrids/plugin"), // Add this line
    // ... your existing plugins
  ],
};
```
This ensures that Tailwind CSS processes the classes provided by TailGrids and that the plugin's functionalities are enabled.

**Step 3: Rebuild Your CSS**
After updating your `tailwind.config.js`, you'll need to re-run your Tailwind CSS build command to generate the updated CSS file that includes styles from TailGrids.

```sh
npm run build:css # Or whatever your build script is
```
If you are using a framework like Next.js or Create React App with Tailwind CSS, the build process might be handled automatically by your development server. Simply restart your development server to apply the changes.

**Step 4: Copy and Paste Components**
You can now copy any component from GrayGrids and paste it into your existing project's HTML, JSX, or TSX files. The styles will be automatically applied by Tailwind CSS.
